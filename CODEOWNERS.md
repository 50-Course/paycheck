## CODEOWNERS

#### Instructions

```markdown
This file is used to define the owners of the codebase. The owners are responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests. The CODEOWNERS file is used by GitHub to automatically request reviews from the owners when a pull request is created.
If you have administrative access to this repository, please think carefully about who you add as a code owner. You should only add people who are familiar with the codebase and have the time to review pull requests.

#### How to add a code owner

To add a code owner, add a line to this file with the path to the file or directory you want to assign an owner to, followed by the GitHub username of the owner. For example:
```

# Assign the user @octocat as the owner of the file CODEOWNERS.md

@octocat <name of the file or module owned worked on>

```

To assign multiple owners to a file or directory, separate the usernames with a space. For example:

```

# Assign the users @octocat and @hubot as the owners of the file CODEOWNERS.md

@octocat @hubot <name of the file or module owned worked on>

```

```
